Below are a lots of links to help guide you in learning R. The awesome-r website has a lot of useful information about R. They spent a lot of time compiling all this information into one site. Its worth taking a look. <https://awesome-r.com/>

This site has a list of R books.
<http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/r/>

I highly recommend this book. I own a copy and I tell my co-workers who want to learn R to read it.
*The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design*

I found out about this R package called swirl after the Analytics Boot Camp. This R packages teaches you R. I tried it out and it is really good. If want to try it out here the instructions for getting it installed and getting started.

Step 1) start R studio
Step 2) in the bottom left window (command line window/ console)
Type the following into the command line at the &gt; prompt. To start typing just left click inside the window.

``` r
install.packages("swirl")
```

This will install the swirl package. After the install is finished, we want to load the swirl package. Now type the following into the command line at the &gt; prompt

``` r
library("swirl")
```

to start the program type the following into the command line.

``` r
swirl()
```

This will start the program and take you through steps of learning R. To exit the program type the following.

``` r
bye()
```

It will save the progress. The website for this package is here:
